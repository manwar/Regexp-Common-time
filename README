Regexp::Common::time v0.08
==========================

This is a Regexp::Common plugin that provides regular expressions for
parsing dates and times.  It can handle most date formats, such as:

      y/m/d               m/d/y               d/m/y
    2005/04/02          4/2/2005            2/4/05
    05.04.02            04.02.05            02.04.2005
    2005 April 2        April 2, 2005       2 APR 05
    05APRIL02           APR022005           02 April 2005
    20050402            040205              02042005

      ISO 8601            RFC 2822
  2008-05-24T21:46:01   25 May 2008 21:46:01 +0500


It can also handle time formats like:

    9:03:27pm
    21:03:27
    9:03 p.m.
    21:03
    9:03a

Furthermore, you can easily piece together time and date component
patterns (in the style of Time::Format or POSIX's strftime) to build
arbitrarily complex custom regexes that can parse just about any time
or date pattern imaginable.
